Preheat oven to 425˚F/220˚C.

In a large pot, bring 4 quarts of water to a rolling boil. 

Remove the woody ends of the asparagus and discard. Cut the remaining spears into quarters and place on a baking sheet. Drizzle olive oil, salt, and pepper over the asparagus and toss so each piece is evenly coated. Bake for 10 minutes.

In the boiling water, cook the penne for 10–12 minutes, or until al dente, and drain. 

Using a blender or food processor, blend basil, pine nuts, garlic, and olive oil until it becomes a paste. Add in Parmesan and salt and blend. 

In a large bowl, combine cooked pasta, sun-dried tomatoes, roasted asparagus, and pesto (about 3 hefty tablespoons). Toss together and serve hot or cold, and top with Parmesan cheese. Enjoy!
P.S. Leftover ratatouille is delicious on its own or with pasta.

One-Pan Basil Halloumi Chicken;http://bzfd.it/1NlNVRr;521611;68958;One-Pan Basil Halloumi Chicken;|2 chicken breasts||1 8oz block of halloumi cheese ||2 cartons red cherry tomatoes||4 large leaves Basil ||2 tsp salt (or to taste)||2 tsp pepper (or to taste) ||1/3 cup olive oil ||Basil Oil:||1/3 cup olive oil ||3 garlic cloves||2 large handfuls of basil ||1 tsp salt ||1 tsp pepper ||Juice from ½ a lemon|||;|
Preheat your oven to 350˚F / 175˚ C 

Turn the block of halloumi on its side and cut it into three to four even slices. Set aside. Pour the olive oil, salt, and pepper into a large plastic bag. Put the tomatoes and chicken in and massage until everything is evenly coated in the seasoned oil. Dump everything onto a foil lined baking sheet. Top the chicken with the large basil leaves and then the slices of halloumi. 

Bake for 15 minutes at 350˚, then turn on the broil setting and cook for another 10 minutes or until the cheese is golden brown and the chicken is cooked. (note: oven times vary, especially broil so keep an eye on it!) Take the chicken out and let it rest on a plate and continue to cook the tomatoes for 10 more minutes back on 350˚ F. (They will become super sweet and have a great concentrated tomato flavor!)

Meanwhile, add the olive oil, garlic, salt, pepper, and lemon juice to a blender and blitz for 30 seconds. Next add the basil and blitz until it's the consistency of pesto, about 30 seconds.

Slow-Roasted Honey Glazed Pork ;http://bzfd.it/1S41uUA;415255;59719;Recipe: Slow-Roasted Honey Glazed Pork;|1 cup plus 2 Tbsp. soy sauce, divided||¼ cup granulated sugar||3 Tbsp. chopped garlic||¼ cup chopped scallions||2–3 pounds boneless, skin-on pork shoulder||1 bunch asparagus, halved||6 Yukon potatoes, diced||2 Tbsp. olive oil||Kosher salt||Freshly ground black pepper||1 cup packed dark brown sugar||½ cup honey|||;|
Preheat the oven to 275ºF.
In a large bowl, combine one cup of the soy sauce with the sugar, garlic, and scallions, stirring until mixed.
Score the skin of the pork by slicing a crosshatch pattern through the skin down to the meat. This will help excess fat render out and allow more of the marinade to soak in.
Place the pork in the marinade and toss to coat evenly. Marinate for one hour.
On a baking sheet, place the asparagus halves to the right and diced potatoes to the left. Toss the vegetables with the oil, salt, and pepper. Place the marinated pork in the middle of the baking sheet. Bake one to one and a half hours, depending on the weight of the pork.
Raise the heat of the oven to 500ºF.
In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar, honey, and remaining soy sauce, stirring until smooth.
Spoon the honey glaze over the top of the pork, making sure to fill the cracks and crevices on top. Bake for 20 minutes until sugar is dark brown and caramelized, and the top of the pork is crispy.
Remove the vegetables and pork from the tray, making sure to save all the juices.
Slice the pork into ½-inch slices, and plate with the roasted vegetables. Spoon the reserved pan juices on top of the pork, and enjoy!

Churro Ice Cream Bowls;http://bzfd.it/23kHxS0;1826512;367495;Recipe: Churro Ice Cream Bowls;|¼ cup butter, cubed||2 Tbsp. brown sugar||½ tsp salt||1 cup water||1 cup flour||1 tsp vanilla||4 eggs||Cooking-oil spray||Oil for frying||Cinnamon sugar||Ice cream||Hot fudge||caramel topping||Equipment:|||;|In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, add butter, brown sugar, salt, and water, and bring to a boil. As soon as the butter has fully melted and the mixture begins to boil, reduce the heat to medium-low and add in flour. Using a wooden spoon, stir until the dough comes together to form a ball (about 1 minute). Remove from heat and let cool for 5 minutes before proceeding to the next step (to prevent accidentally cooking the eggs).
Mix in the vanilla extract and add in the eggs, one at a time, being sure to fully incorporate each egg before adding the next. Once all the eggs are incorporated, transfer it to a piping bag with a small star tip.
Invert a muffin tin and spray thoroughly with nonstick cooking spray. Pipe the dough around the inverted cups in spirals to form the bowls. Immediately transfer the tray to the freezer and freeze until solid (about 3 hours or overnight).
Heat oil in a deep pot to 350˚F (175˚C). Remove the muffin tin from the freezer and flex it to release the churro bowls (you may need to also use a small knife under the bottom edge to initially release them). Return any extras to the freezer while you wait to fry.
Fry them in batches, until nicely browned, no more than 3 at a time. Be sure to carefully tip them into the oil so they sink to the bottom. Once desired color is reached, remove them from the oil to a paper towel–lined plate. Dab off any excess oil then roll them in cinnamon sugar. Fill with your favorite ice cream and toppings.

Steak Stuffed Garlic Bread;http://bzfd.it/22spbxX;415475;55425;Steak-Stuffed Garlic Bread;|3 tablespoons canola oil||1 pound rib eye steak||¾ tablespoon Kosher salt||½ tablespoon freshly ground black pepper||2 tablespoons unsalted butter||2 sprigs rosemary||2 cloves garlic, smashed||1 baguette||4 tablespoons melted butter||2 tablespoons chopped garlic||2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese||2 tablespoons finely chopped parsley|||;|
Preheat oven to 350°F.
Slice the steak in half lengthwise then season all of the sides with the salt and pepper. Heat oil in a pan over extremely high heat until oil is slightly smoking.
Sear the steak for about one minute, then flip. Add the butter, rosemary, and garlic, swirling the pan so that the butter melts. Tilt the pan towards you, and using a large spoon, constantly scoop the melted butter on top of the steak, basting it for about one minute. This helps cook the top of the steak faster and provide more flavor. Sear the sides of the steak for about 30 seconds, then remove it from heat completely. Repeat with the other strip of steak.
Cut the ends off the baguette and remove the insides using a knife. Once the steaks are completely cool, stuff the hollowed out baguettes with the steak. Place the baguettes on a baking sheet.
In a medium bowl, combine the melted butter, garlic, Parmesan, and parsley, stirring until evenly combined. Spread the garlic butter evenly on top of the steak-stuffed baguettes. Bake for 15–20 minutes, depending on how you like your steak.
Slices into one inch bites and serve!
