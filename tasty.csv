Butterscotch Shot Glasses #TastyHappyHour; Shot glasses perfect for your evening cocktail, yes indeed!;|Yields: 1 shot glass||7 hard candies (We used butterscotch.)|||;|Preheat the oven to 300˚F/150˚C. ||Cut parchment paper into a 5×5 square and place on a baking sheet. Arrange candies into a circle with one candy in the middle. Bake for about five minutes, or until the candies have melted into one molten piece. Slide parchment paper and molten candy from the baking tray to a cold counter top and let it cool for 30-45 seconds. CAREFULLY (will still be very hot) and quickly peel the paper off and place the center of the candy on an upside down shot glass. Push the sides of the candy down around the glass quickly with your fingers and let it harden and cool to room temperature. Make sure that whatever liquid you are pouring and the candy shot glass are the same temperature, or else the candy will crack.|||;https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-03/17/19/enhanced/webdr14/enhanced-2189-1458258817-1.jpg;https://img.youtube.com/vi/iKCOCGnFUCo/2.jpg;{"video": {"size": "big", "width":"625", "height":"376", "url":"https://youtube.com/watch?v=iKCOCGnFUCo", "id":"4185922_8246258", "length":"29", "published":"2016-03-17 20:04:36"}}
Raspberry Mojitos #TastyHappyHour; #TastyHappyHour is about to get a lot more TASTY with this delightful ;|Makes one cocktail.||||1/2 lime, cut into wedges||5-6 raspberries (a nice handful of ‘em)||1 spoonful of sugar||10-12 mint leaves (a good bunch)||2 ounces white rum||Club soda|||||;|Throw the lime wedges, raspberries, mint, and sugar into a glass. Then, using a muddler or wooden spoon, press down on the ingredients to mush them all together and get all of the juice out of the lime wedges. Add ice and pour in rum (you can just eyeball the amount, if you don’t have something handy to measure) and then top the glass off with club soda. ||If you want it a little more or less sweet, you can always add slightly more or slightly less sugar. It’s also delicious with less rum, or no rum at all. Play around with the recipe and find the right ratio for you and your friends.|||;https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-03/11/14/enhanced/webdr13/enhanced-5678-1457726304-1.jpg;https://img.youtube.com/vi/8zxmG178wOI/2.jpg;{"video": {"size": "big", "width":"625", "height":"376", "url":"https://youtube.com/watch?v=8zxmG178wOI", "id":"4180058_8191802", "length":"No image found", "published":"2016-03-11 16:07:44"}}
🍓Sparkling Strawberry Kiwi Sangria #TastyHappyHour🍓; #TastyHappyHour is back at it again with another tasty drink. Kick back with this sparkling strawberry kiwi sangria and enjoy!;|||1 lb strawberries||1 lb kiwis||1 cup light rum||1 bottle white wine (such as sauvignon blanc)||1 bottle sparkling wine, chilled (such as cava)||1 cup sugar||1 cup water||3 oranges||A pitcher or other large container|||||;|Hull the strawberries and cut them in half. Peel the kiwis and cut them into slices.||Combine half of the halved strawberries, the sugar, and the water in a saucepan, and turn the heat up to medium. Bring the mixture to a boil and then let simmer, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes or until the strawberries seem like they’re about to fall apart. Let cool for a few minutes, and then, using a mesh sieve, strain the strawberry goodness into a bowl. Use a spoon to press the strawberries up against the mesh so you get every last beautiful drop of strawberry syrup. Place the syrup in the refrigerator to cool a bit.||Combine the kiwi slices and the remaining strawberries in a pitcher, and add the rum, white wine, strawberry syrup, and the juice of three oranges (in a pinch, you could also sub a few splashes of bottled orange juice, or even lemonade, for the fresh orange juice). Give it all a good stir and then pop the pitcher in the refrigerator for at least four hours to let all of the flavors come together.||When you’re ready to serve, add around three-quarters of the chilled sparkling wine to the pitcher. Pour into glasses and spoon in fruit, topping off each glass with a bit of the remaining champagne so it’s nice and bubbly when you hand the glass to a friend.|||;https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-03/4/16/enhanced/webdr14/enhanced-22493-1457128135-8.jpg;https://img.youtube.com/vi/AQKn5rRMjx8/2.jpg;{"video": {"size": "big", "width":"625", "height":"376", "url":"https://youtube.com/watch?v=AQKn5rRMjx8", "id":"4174221_8138689", "length":"61", "published":"2016-03-04 19:20:16"}}
🍹Homemade Frozen Margaritas #TastyHappyHour🍹; These ;|||750ml (25 oz.) tequila||1L (34 oz.) limemade (lemonade can also work in a pinch)||2 cups (16 oz.) orange juice||3-quart baking dish (or similar container)|||||;|This recipe is super simple!||Combine the tequila, limeade (or lemonade), and orange juice in your dish, give it a stir, and then pop it in the freezer for at least five hours. Once it’s frozen into a solid, you’re ready to serve. ||Take it out of the freezer and, using a spoon, scrape along the surface to pull up beautiful shards of frozen margarita (the motion is somewhere between scooping up ice cream and scraping off a car windshield in winter).||Feel free to play around with the ratio on this — it’ll work with a bit less tequila and more juice, or a bit more tequila and less juice (whatever kind of party you’re looking for). Salted rim totally optional.
